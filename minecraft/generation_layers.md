# Generation Layers

Versions Beta 1.8 and later use a system of world generation using generation layers. *(b1.8-r1.1 Four)* / *(1.2+ Two)* generation layer instances are used:
1. Biomes for world generation (4x4 per chunk)
2. Biomes for indexing (16x16 per chunk)
3. *(b1.8-r1.1 Temperature)*
4. *(b1.8-r1.1 Rainfall)*
