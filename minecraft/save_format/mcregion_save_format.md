# McRegion Save Format
McRegion is a save format introduced in Beta 1.3 using code from Scaevolus' original [McRegion](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/mods-discussion/1346703-mod-mcregion-v5-optimized-saves-1-2_02) mod. This format was later succeeded by the [Anvil](anvil_save_format.md) save format in 1.2.1.

## File Structure
Region files are stored within the `region` folder of a world. A single region file is composed 1,024 chunks. An example of a region  file name wouldbe `r.8.20.mcr`, where `8` and `20` are the X and Z coordinates of the region respectively.

## File Header
TODO: Document location/timestamp tables as well as the chunk headers.

## Chunk Format
Each chunk has a 5 byte header, followed by a compressed compound tag.

**Header** (in order)
| Type | Size | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Integer | 4 | The length of the compressed chunk data in bytes.|
| Byte | 1 | The compression type of the chunk. `1` for gzip and `2` for deflate. |

**Data**
| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `xPos` | Integer | The X position of the chunk.
| `zPos` | Integer | The Z position of the chunk.
| `LastUpdate` | Long | The in-game time when the chunk was updated last.
| `Blocks` | Byte Array | Stores a byte indicating the block ID.
| `Data` | Nibble Array | Stores the metadata value of the block, sometimes used for direction/block variants.
| `SkyLight` | Nibble Array | Stores the sun light propagation of each block.
| `BlockLight` | Nibble Array | Stores the light value of each block.
| `TerrainPopulated` | Byte | Whether any features have been generated yet.
| `HeightMap`| Byte Array | Stores the top block height of each block.
| `Entities` | List | A list containing compound tags of mobs/entities in the chunk.
| `TileEntities` | List | Same as above but with [block entities]().
