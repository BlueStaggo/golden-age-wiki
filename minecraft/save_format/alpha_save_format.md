# "Alpha" Save Format
The Alpha save format was introduced in Infdev 20100327 and was discontinued in Beta 1.3, with the exclusion of the [Infdev 20100624](624_save_format.md) save format. This was later succeeded by the [McRegion](mcregion_save_format.md) save format, which was created to stop unnecessary disk usage.
