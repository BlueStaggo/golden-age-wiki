# Infdev 20100624 Save Format
The Infdev 20100624 save format was introduced in Infdev 20100624 and was immediately discontinued after the save format caused saves to become massive due to NBT data being saved as uncompressed data. With a similar basis as McRegion, chunks were stored in files called Zones. Uniquely though, Notch decided to make entities be saved separately from chunks, which meant that any amount of entities loading would rapidly cause file utilization, which would slow the game to a halt.
